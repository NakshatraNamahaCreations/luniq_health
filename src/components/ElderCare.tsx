                Elder care also referred to as senior care, is a special care service designed to meet 
                the varied needs and requirements of senior citizen home care. Elder care is a vast field 
                and includes varied services like assisted living, nursing care, adult day care, and home care.

                Although old age itself is no reason to consider Eldercare, it is the varied physical 
                disabilities and diseases that lead a person to contemplate availing elder care services.

                A large number of senior citizens still live with their family and their care is jointly 
                undertaken by family members. However, in today's situation, there are cases when most 
                family members work and are unable to give proper attention and care to their ailing 
                seniors and as such seek reliable and efficient eldercare programs.

              <p>
                Elder care often becomes necessary when the elder starts experiencing difficulty with 
                activities of daily living, both independently and safely. Daily activities may include 
                cleaning, cooking, dressing, bathing, driving, taking medicines, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Elder Care is mostly needed when there is a gradual decline in an elder's health with 
                growing age, but it may also arise in emergency cases. For example, the elder one in 
                your family is recovering from a broken joint or recently had a heart stroke and is 
                still going through the cognitive and physical after effects.

                and less resilient.

                don't report a physical impairment, hence it is important to get a complete physical 
                examination on a regular basis.
